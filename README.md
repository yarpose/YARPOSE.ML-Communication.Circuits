By [Ali Pakzad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-pakzad-075a36227/) and [M. B. Ghaznavi-Ghoushchi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghaznavi-ghoushchi/).

Version 2024.01

A Full open-source/Full with Python/ interactive course for all who like to know "What are Communication Circuits?" from scratch to basic applications.
This is the repo of **ML-Assisted Basics of Communication Circuits for ALL**  project. It brings ALL of **Basic Communication Circuits** into browser via Python jupyter including examples, plots, equations, simulations and narration. The narrations of text is generated via ML tools.


This project is based on:

1. Python
2. Jupyetr notebook and runnable on Google colab
3. schemdraw library
4. PySpice simulation wrapper
5. ElevenLabs.io (ML generated human voices for whole of the project)
6. Good learning resources
7. ... and days and hours of our hardworks 



# Course contents:

0. Introduction
1. Resonance. circuits 
2. Tuned amplifiers
3. Sine wave oscillators
4. Mixers and AM and FM modulation
5. How to install and use required tools/libraries


# ALL Circuit are drawn via Python in Jypyter
ALL the schmatics of the circuits are reporduced utilizing ```schemdraw``` python library.

# Circuit simulation utilizing PySpice
ALL the simulations of the circuits are performed utilizing ```PySpice``` python library.

# Interactive features in circuit draw and simulation
ALL the interactive features in circuit re-draw and parameter modifications are implemented utilizing ```ipywidgets``` python library.

# ML-assisted text narration
ALL the course text materials are narrated by ML-assisted  ```ElevenLabs.io```.

# Circuit explanation utilizing LaTeX
ALL the interactive features in circuit re-draw and parameter modifications are implemented utilizing $LaTeX$ 

# All in one bunch of codes, figures, audio, etc.
ALL of codes, figures, ipynb, docx are ready to download and re-use under the copyright notice verbatim. 

# Unique "Spoon" style of Jupyter Python coding 
We followed stand-alone coding for each example just like insert your spoon in Dessert and eat each section without need to run its upper or lower jupyter cells which usually you see in the most of ```jupyter notebooks``` samples. This enables reader to look at each example as a fully seperated and functional code.

# Fully open-source course
The project is totally open-source in hope of help to extended ease of undersating for "Basics of Communication Circuits".

# Contests are in Compliance with "Basics of Communication Circuits "
The contents of this project are ready to use for secod year undergraduate courses like:
 1. Basics of Communication Circuits
 2. Communication Circuits I
 3. Communication Circuits Theory.
